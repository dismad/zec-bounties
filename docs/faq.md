# FAQ

Common questions about addresses, payouts, roles, and using the platform.

## Why was my transparent address rejected?

Payouts are shielded-only. Provide a Unified Address with a shielded receiver (Ironwood / Sapling preferred). See [Addresses](addresses.md).

## What address should I use?

Preferred: a UA with **shielded receivers only** (Ironwood / Sapling). A UA that also includes a transparent receiver is **allowed**, with a warning — see [Addresses](addresses.md). Transparent-only addresses are rejected.

## Can I use a UA that has both shielded and transparent receivers?

Yes. It is accepted as long as a shielded receiver is present. Platform payouts use the shielded path. The transparent receiver can still receive public funds if used elsewhere — prefer shielded-only when your wallet allows it.

## Can I change my payout address later?

Yes. Update it in [Profile](https://bounties.zechub.wiki/profile). Future payments use the address on file when the payment runs.

## Hunter or Team — which should I pick?

- **Hunter** if you will apply to bounties yourself. See [Hunters](hunters.md).
- **Team** if you will post and fund work as a group. See [Teams](teams.md).

Onboarding sets this once. Normal accounts cannot switch later. Admin is not a self-serve option.

## I picked the wrong role. Can I change it?

Not self-serve. Ask a platform admin if the account must move. Do not create a second GitHub login unless an admin tells you to.

## Does creating a team make me a platform admin?

No. Team OWNER/ADMIN only manage that team. Platform Admin is a separate role. Team verification also requires three platform admins.

## My work was approved but I have not been paid.

Confirm the bounty is marked done / payment authorized. If it stays stuck, contact the bounty creator or ZecHub admins. Check that your registered UA is still valid.

## Do I need to share my seed phrase?

No. For normal use the platform only needs your receive address. Never paste a seed or spending key into the site.

## Is this mainnet?

Yes. Live payouts use mainnet ZEC. Treat amounts and addresses as real value.

## Why did the ZEC amount on a bounty change?

The form only stores ZEC. Creators pick that number from an implicit USD interval (`usd_target / zec_usd_spot`). If the spot moves ≥ 20%, a week has passed, or payout is about to run, they should edit the ZEC field so the implied dollar value stays in the same band. See [Bounty amounts](bounty-amounts.md).

## Are the old tip amounts (0.05 ZEC, 0.08 ZEC, …) still used?

Those were snapshots at an older ZEC/USD rate. Suggest from the USD intervals on [Bounty amounts](bounty-amounts.md), then enter the converted ZEC amount.
