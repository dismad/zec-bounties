  {
    q: "Why was my transparent address rejected?",
    a: (
      <>
        Payouts are shielded-only. Provide a Unified Address with a shielded
        receiver (Ironwood / Sapling preferred). See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/addresses" className="text-primary hover:underline">
          Addresses

    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What address should I use?",
    a: (
      <>
        Preferred: a UA with <strong>shielded receivers only</strong> (Ironwood
        / Sapling). A UA that also includes a transparent receiver is{" "}
        <strong>allowed</strong>, with a warning — see{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/addresses" className="text-primary hover:underline">
          Addresses
        </Link>
        . Transparent-only addresses are rejected.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a UA that has both shielded and transparent receivers?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. It is accepted as long as a shielded receiver is present. Platform
        payouts use the shielded path. The transparent receiver can still
        receive public funds if used elsewhere — prefer shielded-only when your
        wallet allows it.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change my payout address later?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Update it in{" "}
        <Link href="/profile" className="text-primary hover:underline">
          Profile
        </Link>
        . Future payments use the address on file when the payment runs.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Hunter or Team — which should I pick?",
    a: (
      <>
        <strong>Hunter</strong> if you will apply to bounties yourself. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/hunters" className="text-primary hover:underline">
          Hunters
        </Link>
        . <strong>Team</strong> if you will post and fund work as a group. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/teams" className="text-primary hover:underline">
          Teams

        . Onboarding sets this once. Normal accounts cannot switch later. Admin
        is not a self-serve option.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "I picked the wrong role. Can I change it?",
    a: (
      <>
        Not self-serve. Ask a platform admin if the account must move. Do not
        create a second GitHub login unless an admin tells you to.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Does creating a team make me a platform admin?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. Team OWNER/ADMIN only manage that team. Platform Admin is a
        separate role. Team verification also requires three platform admins.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "My work was approved but I have not been paid.",
    a: (
      <>
        Confirm the bounty is marked done / payment authorized. If it stays
        stuck, contact the bounty creator or ZecHub admins. Check that your
        registered UA is still valid.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to share my seed phrase?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. For normal use the platform only needs your receive address. Never
        paste a seed or spending key into the site.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Is this mainnet?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Live payouts use mainnet ZEC. Treat amounts and addresses as real
        value.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Why did the ZEC amount on a bounty change?",
    a: (
      <>
        The form only stores ZEC. Creators pick that number from an implicit
        USD interval (<code>usd_target / zec_usd_spot</code>). If the spot
        moves ≥ 20%, a week has passed, or payout is about to run, they should
        edit the ZEC field so the implied dollar value stays in the same band.

  {
    q: "Are the old tip amounts (0.05 ZEC, 0.08 ZEC, …) still used?",
    a: (
      <>
        Those were snapshots at an older ZEC/USD rate. Suggest from the USD
        intervals on{" "}
